    <h2>TOTAL</h2>
    <p>I think that pleasure is a very difficult behavior. It’s not as simple as that to enjoy one’s self. And I must say that’s my dream. I would like and I hope I die of an overdose of pleasure of any kind.

  </div>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>PLEASURE </h2>
     
    <p>Because I think it’s really difficult and I always have the feeling that I do not feel the pleasure, the complete total pleasure and, for me, it’s related to death.

  </div>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>= DEATH</h2>
  
    <p>Because I think that the kind of pleasure I would consider as the real pleasure, would be so deep, so intense, so overwhelming that I couldn’t survive it. I would die.
