Ebola was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in the democractic Republic of Congo. Since then there have been occasional outbreaks that occur primarily on the African continent. Scientists believe that the virus is spread through direct human contact to the blood, body fluids, and tissues of animals. It then spreads to other humans through direct contact with body fluids of a person who is sick or has died from Ebola. This is a rare but severe and often deadly disease. The course of illness typically progresses from “dry” symptoms initially (such as fever, aches and pains, and fatigue), and then to “wet” symptoms (such as diarrhea and vomiting).
<br><br>
Liberia was a country with widespread Ebola transmission in 2014, with a total of 4,810 deaths. Due to the country's high illiteracy rates that wavered between 52 to 57 percent in the years 2007 to 2017, many of the public health announcements had to have pictorial elements to accompany the text. Educational wall murals such as the one painted by Stephen Doe in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, helped convey key health messages such as the symptoms of Ebola, through simple illustrations.
<br><br>
Illustrations were also used in the national campaign, <em>Ebola Must Go!</em> This campaign defined five essentials (safe burial, rapid isolation of suspected cases, provision of treatment, identification and 21-day monitoring of contacts, and encouragement to speak out against concealment of illness) using commonly used language and pictorial accompaniments.
