Spanish Flu is considered the deadliest pandemic in modern history, infecting a third of the world's population, with a 10% death rate. Besides the lack of basic medical tools and recent discovery of viruses, appalling and cramped living conditions also contributed to the high contraction and death rate of the Spanish Flu. “The trenches would have been the perfect breeding grounds for infections among the World War One soldiers. The virus emerged when populations, which previously had little contact with each other, were brought together on the battlefield,” says Patrick Saunders-Hastings at Carleton University in Ottawa. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing became important to help mitigate the spread of the disease. Lifebuoy Soap created a series of ads in 1918 to educate the public about personal hygiene to prevent the spread of Spanish Influenza. By explaining and visually displaying how their product worked to keep your hands “antiseptically clean”, they were effectively able to sell more of their soap products by presenting themselves as trustworthy and necessary during the pandemic.
