HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks and weakens the body’s immune system and its ability to recognize and fight infections. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in a set of symptoms and illnesses that happen at the final stage of HIV infection if left untreated. In 1981, the Center of Disease Control reported that five previously healthy homosexual men had contracted a rare yeast-like fungus called Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which is the most common opportunistic infection in people with AIDS. In that same year, a cluster of homosexual patients in New York and California suffered from an agressive skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma. By the end of 1981, 121 gay men died of severe immune deficienty. Men who have sex with men were disproportionately impacted by HIV because it transmits much more easily through anal sex than through vaginal sex.

The virus was first publicly mentioned by U.S. president Ronald Regan in 1986, which was more than five years after the first CDC report. The Reagan administration has been heavily criticized for their lack of response to the AIDS crisis as it affected thousands of people in American cities in the 1980s. Dubbed “The Gay Plague”, the AIDS epidemic stigmizited gay men, and the death toll continued to climb as the Reagan ignored activists demands for more attention to the growing medical crisis.

In 1987, a group of frustrated activists in New York City came together and started ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, a grassroots political group working to “end the AIDS Pandemic, and improve the lives of people with AIDS through direct action, medical research, treatment and advocacy, and working to change legislation and policies.” In 1990 they attempted to seize control of the National Institutes of Health by occupying their campus and calling on scientists to develop more drugs for people with AIDS and the federal government to disseminate drugs equitably. ACT UP used printed materials such as the “Storm the NIH” posters to gather people to attend specific media events and demonstrations. They used techniques of  photography and photomontage to create bold compositions and ignite action.
