	<h1>Cholera Pandemics 1-6 (1817-1923)
	<br>Type: V. Cholerae Bacteria
	<br>Death toll: 1M+ *A series of Cholera outbreaks spread around the world in the 1800s killing millions of people. There is no solid consensus on death tolls.
	</h1>
  <p>Cholera is an infectious disease caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. Obstetrician John Snow is widely credited for proving that Cholera was a waterborne disease, and not caused by breathing vapors or a miasma in the atmosphere, which was a sensible theory given that the air always smelled terrible from the cesspools around the city. In 1854, Snow used an annotated map to prove that people living in the London suburb of Soho were being infected by a contaminated water source at the Broad Street water pump. Human fecal matter was mixed in the water supply causing more than 500 fatal attacks of Cholera in the first ten days in this neighborhood. By using data visualization that showed clusters of cases represented as little dots around the Broad Street Water pump he was able to convince authorities to close the pump and the outbreak quickly ended. This infographic was the most effective tool to persuade people of the outbreak's source.</p>

	Death toll: 40-50M</h1>
  	<p>Spanish Flu is considered the deadliest pandemic in modern history, infecting a third of the world's population, with a 10% death rate. Besides the lack of basic medical tools and recent discovery of viruses, appalling and cramped living conditions also contributed to the high contraction and death rate of the Spanish Flu. “The trenches would have been the perfect breeding grounds for infections among the World War One soldiers. The virus emerged when populations, which previously had little contact with each other, were brought together on the battlefield,” says Patrick Saunders-Hastings at Carleton University in Ottawa. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing became important to help mitigate the spread of the disease. Lifebuoy Soap created a series of ads in 1918 to educate the public about personal hygiene to prevent the spread of Spanish Influenza. By explaining and visually displaying how their product worked to keep your hands “antiseptically clean”, they were effectively able to sell more of their soap products by presenting themselves as trustworthy and necessary during the pandemic.</p>

	HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks and weakens the body’s immune system and its ability to recognize and fight infections. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in a set of symptoms and illnesses that happen at the final stage of HIV infection if left untreated. In 1981, the Center of Disease Control reported that five previously healthy homosexual men had contracted a rare yeast-like fungus called Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which is the most common opportunistic infection in people with AIDS. In that same year, a cluster of homosexual patients in New York and California suffered from an agressive skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma. By the end of 1981, 121 gay men died of severe immune deficienty. Men who have sex with men were disproportionately impacted by HIV because it transmits much more easily through anal sex than through vaginal sex. 
	<br><br>
	The virus was first publicly mentioned by U.S. president Ronald Regan in 1986, which was more than five years after the first CDC report. The Reagan administration has been heavily criticized for their lack of response to the AIDS crisis as it affected thousands of people in American cities in the 1980s. Dubbed “The Gay Plague”, the AIDS epidemic stigmizited gay men, and the death toll continued to climb as the Reagan ignored activists demands for more attention to the growing medical crisis.
	<br><br>
	In 1987, a group of frustrated activists in New York City came together and started ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, a grassroots political group working to “end the AIDS Pandemic, and improve the lives of people with AIDS through direct action, medical research, treatment and advocacy, and working to change legislation and policies.” In 1990 they attempted to seize control of the National Institutes of Health by occupying their campus and calling on scientists to develop more drugs for people with AIDS and the federal government to disseminate drugs equitably. ACT UP used printed materials such as the “Storm the NIH” posters to gather people to attend specific media events and demonstrations. They used techniques of  photography and photomontage to create bold compositions and ignite action.

	</h1>
  	<p>
	Ebola was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in the democractic Republic of Congo. Since then there have been occasional outbreaks that occur primarily on the African continent. Scientists believe that the virus is spread through direct human contact to the blood, body fluids, and tissues of animals. It then spreads to other humans through direct contact with body fluids of a person who is sick or has died from Ebola. This is a rare but severe and often deadly disease. The course of illness typically progresses from “dry” symptoms initially (such as fever, aches and pains, and fatigue), and then to “wet” symptoms (such as diarrhea and vomiting).
	<br><br>
	Liberia was a country with widespread Ebola transmission in 2014, with a total of 4,810 deaths. Due to the country's high illiteracy rates that wavered between 52 to 57 percent in the years 2007 to 2017, many of the public health announcements had to have pictorial elements to accompany the text. Educational wall murals such as the one painted by Stephen Doe in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, helped convey key health messages such as the symptoms of Ebola, through simple illustrations.
	<br><br>
	Illustrations were also used in the national campaign, <em>Ebola Must Go!</em> This campaign defined five essentials (safe burial, rapid isolation of suspected cases, provision of treatment, identification and 21-day monitoring of contacts, and encouragement to speak out against concealment of illness) using commonly used language and pictorial accompaniments.

	<br><br>
	The Coronavirus is an infectious disease which causes respiratory illness which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze, or when a person touches a surface or object that the virus lives on, then touches their face. Although most cases have been reported to be mild, some patients experience severe complications with the virus such as developing pneumonia in both lungs, multi-organ failure, and in some cases death.
	<br><br>
	In epidemiology, the idea of slowing a virus' spread so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time is known as flattening the curve. The New York Times has been publishing interactive news stories which help their viewers understand how numbers alter and consequences change based on different variables. In this screenshot, from the story, <em>How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get, in Charts</em> published on March 13, the reader can drag the <em>Additional Interventions begin</em> line and observe how interventions such as social distancing and staying at home can make a difference.
