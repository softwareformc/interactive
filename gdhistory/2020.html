The Coronavirus is an infectious disease which causes respiratory illness which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze, or when a person touches a surface or object that the virus lives on, then touches their face. Although most cases have been reported to be mild, some patients experience severe complications with the virus such as developing pneumonia in both lungs, multi-organ failure, and in some cases death.
<br><br>
In epidemiology, the idea of slowing a virus' spread so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time is known as flattening the curve. The New York Times has been publishing interactive news stories which help their viewers understand how numbers alter and consequences change based on different variables. In this screenshot, from the story, <em>How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get, in Charts</em> published on March 13, the reader can drag the <em>Additional Interventions begin</em> line and observe how interventions such as social distancing and staying at home can make a difference.
