	1854: John Snow’s Broad Street Map<br>
 	Cholera Pandemics 1-6 (1817-1923)<br>
	Type: V. Cholerae Bacteria<br>
	Death toll: 1M+ <em>*A series of Cholera outbreaks spread around the world in the 1800s killing millions of people. There is no solid consensus on death tolls.</em></h1>

<p>
Cholera is an infectious disease caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. Obstetrician John Snow is widely credited for proving that Cholera was a waterborne disease, and not caused by breathing vapors or a <em>miasma in the atmosphere</em>, which was a sensible theory given that the air always smelled terrible from the cesspools around the city. In 1854, Snow used an annotated map to prove that people living in the London suburb of Soho were being infected by a contaminated water source at the Broad Street water pump. Human fecal matter was mixed in the water supply causing more than 500 fatal attacks of Cholera in the first ten days in this neighborhood. By using data visualization that showed clusters of cases represented as little dots around the Broad Street Water pump he was able to convince authorities to close the pump and the outbreak quickly ended. This infographic was the most effective tool to persuade people of the outbreak's source.
