	About this Site
 	</h1>

<p>
Visual communication plays a vital role in informing or persuading the public how to protect themselves and others during global outbreaks of disease and illness. This site displays graphic design artifacts from five different pandemics in the past 150 years. This is a selection of artifacts showing how governments, citizens, activists, advertisers, and scientists have used visual tools to convey a message related to a pandemic. This site was made by M.C. Madrigal for Doug Scott’s History of Graphic Design course at Yale University for the spring 2020 semester.
